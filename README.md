HTML Resume Website

Welcome to my Capstone Project 1! 🎓  
This is a simple and professional personal website built using **only HTML** to showcase my resume, hobbies, contact information, and more.

🌟 About This Project

The goal of this project is to create a personal multi-page resume-style website using just HTML (no CSS frameworks or JavaScript). The project includes different pages like:

- `index.html` - My Resume (Main Page)
- `about.html` - About Me
- `hobbies.html` - My Hobbies
- `internships.html` - My Internships
- `contact.html` - Contact Information

Each page is linked together using anchor tags for seamless navigation.


✨ Features

- Clean layout with semantic HTML
- Internal navigation using anchor tags
- Organized and readable HTML structure
- Styled using a separate `style.css` file
- Mobile-responsive and accessible
